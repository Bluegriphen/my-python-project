OOP in python

To map with real world scenarios, we started using objects in code
This is called object oriented programming.

Class & Object in python
    
Class is a blueprint for creating objects.
    #creating Class
    class Student:
        name = "Karan Kumar"
    
    #creating object(instance)
    s1 = Student()
    print(s1.name)
